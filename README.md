# cs338-Final-project

Problem Description: 
As a student in Drexel, one the most exciting thing would be have a real job experience during college. Good coop would be a good starting point of your career, so it is important to know what you will do during coop. I heard some of my friends complained their job had nothing or less related with their major, so it is kind of waste of time, especially for 4-year-one-coop students. My project aim to design a system that get the evaluation of coop, let students know the detail of work of each companiesâ€™ position. 

User Analysis: 
Users of this system would be Drexel students. Anyone who want get the suitable job can use this system. If students who want to know the positions they want to apply, they can use this system to look it up. The system will show the job experience provided by pre coop students who worked there before. The constraints of this system would be not enough job experience provided by students. 

System Description: 
The system allow users to search evaluation of job positions. Also user can evaluate their job after the coop, so other user can get benefit for it. The overall tasks of system is get the request from users can give response to user. Basically the system get the information of job evaluation for users. For info request process, users need to type in the company and position in search area, and system will list the possible result. For evaluation process, user will need to fill a form which include the company name, position, salary, skills required, job experience, rating and so on.
